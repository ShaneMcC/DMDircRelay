About:
================================================================================

This Bot is a very simple Relay Bot to allow the linking of a single channel
across multiple networks.

This bot was originally designed for #DMDirc after a similar bot was coded for
#IRCReport, this bot soon replaced the original IRCReport bot.

================================================================================
Usage:
================================================================================

The bot has no concept of access levels other than "half-op or above", "admin"
or "anyone". By default "admin" is the same as "half-op or above" unless 

Half-Op or above on the channel:
---------
!sync                            -> Set all topics to that of the main channel
!resettopic                      -> Unset and reset all the topics to ensure
                                    they are all the same
!topic <topic>                   -> Set the topic in all channels to <topic>
!kick <nick>[@network] [reason]  -> Kick a user (optionally on another network)
                                    with the given reason, or "..." if no reason
                                    is given.


All Users (if publicNames is true, else Half-Op or above):
---------
!names <network>|*               -> Show who is on the channel on the given
                                    network (* == all)

Admins (if publicAdmin is true, else Half-Op or above):
---------
!rraw <network> <command>        -> An admin can make the bot send the raw
                                    command <command> on the network <network>
!raw <command>                   -> An admin can make the bot send the raw
                                    command <command> on the current network

(!raw and !sync can be used on any network provided the conditions are met)

================================================================================
Requirements:
================================================================================

JDK 1.6
Ant

================================================================================
Configuration:
================================================================================

Currently configuration is done in the source code.

Edit the variables:
  * relayChannelName  -> Channel to relay (must be the same on all networks)
  * wantedNick        -> Nickname for the bot to use
  * realName          -> Real Name for the bot to use
  * wantedIP          -> The IP Address to attempt to bind to when connecting
  * welcomeMessage    -> A list of lines to send to users who join the relayed
                         channels.
  * publicAdmin       -> Should half-op or above be considered admins?
                         If this is set to false then you should edit the
                         function `isAdmin` at the bottom of the file.
  * publicNames       -> Should !names be open to anyone?
  * relayCommands     -> Should ! commands that are not understood by the bot
                         be relayed to the main channel for other bots?

Theres also the list of servers which are defined as:
  * newParser("server.address", port, "password", new String[]{"Lines to send", "on connect"});

Note that at least 1 parser must be defined as the "mainParser", and that lines
defined as onConnect lines are also sent any time the bot regains its nickname.

================================================================================
Compiling and running:
================================================================================
ant clean jar run

================================================================================
Getting assistance:
================================================================================

This code is provided without any warranty or anything, nor is it expected to be
perfect and bug free. No guarantee as to fitness for purpose is provided either.

The code is also released without any format support, however informal support
can be obtained in #DMDirc on Quakenet, Chatspike, Freenode or OFTC, and on
#IRCReport on Quakenet, Freenode or Chatspike (ask for 'Dataforce')

================================================================================
Client Support:
================================================================================

Support for the output format of the bot is available in a variety of clients,
most notably DMDirc (http://DMDirc.com/) which can be found at:

http://addons.dmdirc.com/addon/50

However a number of #IRCReport regulars have coded similar scripts/addons for
other clients:

http://ircreport.com/book/docs/ircreport/relay-plugins

================================================================================
Thanks:
================================================================================

* Elmaron from #IRCReport for the initial C implementation of the relay bot that
  the output from this one is based on
* Regulars of #DMDirc and #IRCReport for putting up with me restarting the bot
  alot to test it, and for making scripts/addons/plugins to support it.
